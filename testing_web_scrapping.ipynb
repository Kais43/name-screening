His father worked as a plumber before entering the financial industry with his wife. They founded Gibraltar Securities, which was ultimately forced to close by the SEC.\\n\\n\\n Bernie earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Hofstra University in 1960 and briefly attended law school at Brooklyn Law School. While in college, Bernie married his high-school sweetheart, Ruth (née Alpern), with whom he later founded Bernard L.

He soon persuaded family friends and others to invest with him. When the \"Kennedy Slide\" flash crash lopped 20% off the market in 1962, Madoff\\'s bets soured and his father-in-law had to bail him out.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Investopedia / Ellen Lindner\\n\\n  Notable Accomplishments  \\n Madoff had a chip on his shoulder and felt that he was not part of the Wall Street in-crowd. In an interview with journalist Steve Fishman, Madoff advised, \"We were a small firm, we weren\\'t a member of the New York Stock Exchange. It was very obvious.\"', metadata={'url': 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp'}),\n",

However, Madoff deposited client funds into a single bank account that he used to pay existing clients who wanted to cash out.\", metadata={'url': 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp'}),\n",

The following day, they turned him over to the authorities. Bernie remained adamant that his sons were not aware of his scheme.\\n\\n\\n The fund\\'s last statements indicated it had $64.8 billion in client assets.\\n\\n\\n  The Players  \\n It is not certain when Madoff\\'s Ponzi scheme began.

JPMorgan entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors to resolve two felony charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act.

      " Tinkov was told of his filing and tax obligations by both the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and his U.S.-based accountant. When asked by his accountant if his net worth was more than $2 million for purposes of filling out the expatriation form, Tinkov lied and told him he did not have assets above $2 million. When his accountant later inquired whether his net worth was under $2 million, rather than answer the question, Tinkov filled out the expatriation form himself falsely, reporting that his net worth was only $300,000. On Feb. 26, 2014, Tinkov filed a false 2013 individual tax return that falsely reported his income as only $205,317. In addition, Tinkov did not report any of the gain from the constructive sale of his property worth more than $1.1 billion, nor did he pay the applicable taxes \n",

      " Tinkov’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 29 before U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Tinkov agrees to pay no less than $506,828,377, which includes the 2013 taxes, the civil fraud penalty, and statutory interest on that tax, totaling $448,957,108 as well as tax liabilities for other years that Tinkov acknowledged he owes. Per the terms of the plea agreement, the parties have agreed to recommend a custodial sentence of time served, followed by one year of supervised release, and an additional fine of $250,000. This recommendation binds the court once it accepts the plea agreement. \n",

      " “Tinkov renounced his U.S. Citizenship shortly after receiving millions of dollars,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Darrell J. Waldon of the IRS-CI Washington D.C. Field Office. “Despite his knowledge of U.S. tax reporting requirements, he substantially understated his wealth on filings with the IRS. International tax cheats remain a priority for my office and our agency; and as such, the International Tax and Financial Crimes D.C.-based group will continue to aggressively pursue those committing international tax crimes.” \n",

      "“In 2013, when the value of Oleg Tinkov’s investment in his bank’s stock rose to over a billion dollars, Tinkov quickly renounced his U.S. citizenship and then lied to the IRS in a ploy to evade ‘exit taxes’ he knew were due,” said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division. “Today, Tinkov has entered a plea to a felony and agreed to pay more than $500 million in taxes, interest and penalties, more than double the amount of money he sought to escape paying to the U.S. Treasury through his fraudulent scheme.” \n",

From that time through 2013, he filed U.S. tax returns. In late 2005 or 2006, Tinkov founded Tinkoff Credit Services (TCS), a Russia-based branchless bank that provides its customers with online financial and banking services. Through a foreign entity, Tinkov indirectly held the majority of TCS shares. \n",
