In a Ponzi scheme, claims of underlying\\xa0investments are bogus; very few, if any, actual physical assets or financial investments exist. As the\\xa0number of total investors grows and the supply of potential new investors dwindles, there is not\\xa0enough money to pay off promised returns and cover investors who try to cash out. A Ponzi bubble\\xa0bursts when the con artist simply cannot keep up with the required payments. In many cases, the\\xa0perpetrator has spent investment money on personal expenses, depleting funds and accelerating the\\xa0bursting of the bubble.', metadata={'url': 'https://www.nasaa.org/4303/madoff-a-21st-century-ponzi-scheme/'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Madoff Case\\nFor decades, Madoff investors received consistent and steady annual returns through elaborate, fabricated account statements and other documentation that were provided to investors to convince them that their money had been placed in actual investments. The investments “appeared”\\xa0legitimate, especially to people receiving payments. But in reality, there were no actual investments\\xa0and no actual returns.

As Hervé Stolowy explains, the three trust-producing mechanisms identified by Zucker** (process, institution, and characteristic-based trust) operated in parallel and enabled the scheme to keep going.\\nProcess-based trust', metadata={'url': 'https://www.hec.edu/en/trust-and-financial-markets-lessons-madoff-fraud'}),\n",

However, the SEC gave its backing to the Madoff fund for many years, thereby reinforcing the fraudster’s credibility.

One of the organizations interviewed by the researchers had a policy of never investing in a body linked to a member of its board – and that is what saved it. In addition, it is a good idea for investors to apply the principle of diversified investments.

Tinkov has provided to the government and a court in the UK expert medical reports supporting his claim that he is undergoing a UK-based intensive treatment plan for acute myeloid leukemia and graft versus host disease, which has rendered him immunocompromised and unable to safely travel. As part of the plea, Tinkov has agreed to make the expert reports available to the court. \n",

As required under his plea agreement, prior to sentencing, Oleg Tinkov, aka Oleg Tinkoff, paid $508,936,184, more than double what he had sought to escape paying to the U.S. Treasury through a scheme to renounce his U.S. citizenship and conceal from the IRS large stock gains that he knew were reportable. This includes $248,525,339 in taxes, statutory interest on that tax and a nearly $100 million fraud penalty.
